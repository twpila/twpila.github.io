### Overview of Power Tools

Power tools are tools that require an external power source to operate, making them more efficient and suitable for heavy-duty tasks compared to hand tools. These tools can be powered by electricity, batteries, or compressed air.

Common Power Tools:

Drills: Used for creating holes in various materials, such as wood, metal, and concrete.

Cordless Drill: Powered by rechargeable batteries, offering portability.

Hammer Drill: A drill that combines rotary motion with a hammering action, ideal for masonry work.

Saws: Used for cutting materials such as wood, metal, and plastic.

Circular Saw: A versatile saw for straight cuts in wood, metal, and plastic.

Jigsaw: A tool with a straight or curved blade that moves up and down for intricate cuts.

Sanders: Used to smooth surfaces and remove material.

Orbital Sander: Has a circular motion and is great for finishing surfaces.

Belt Sander: A heavy-duty tool that uses a continuous belt to remove material quickly.

Power Source Options:

Electric (corded): Offers consistent power and is suitable for long durations.

Battery-powered (cordless): Provides portability and convenience but may have limited runtime.

Pneumatic (compressed air): Often used in industrial settings for high-power tools.

Safety Tips for Power Tools:

Always read the instruction manual before use.

Wear proper safety equipment, including hearing protection and safety glasses.

Keep the work area clean and well-lit to avoid accidents.
