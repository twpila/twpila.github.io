# Understanding Fasteners

Fasteners are hardware components that are used to join or affix two or more objects together. They come in various forms, each designed for specific purposes and materials.

Types of Fasteners:

Bolts and Nuts: Bolts are used in conjunction with nuts to fasten objects together. Typically used in structural or mechanical applications.

Hex Bolts: These have a hexagonal head and are used with a matching nut.

Carriage Bolts: Often used for wood and metal, they have a round head and a square neck.

Screws: Screws are similar to bolts but typically do not require a nut. They are commonly used in wood, metal, and plastic applications.

Wood Screws: Have sharp threads to grip into wood.

Machine Screws: Used with nuts to fasten metal components.

Rivets: Used for permanent fastening where bolts or screws cannot be used.

Blind Rivets: Can be installed when only one side of the material is accessible.

Material Considerations:

Steel: Common, cost-effective, and durable.

Stainless Steel: Offers resistance to corrosion and is ideal for outdoor or marine applications.

Brass: Often used for decorative or low-stress applications.

Choosing the Right Fastener:

Consider the material being fastened.

Ensure the fastener's size, strength, and type are appropriate for the task.
